Instructions
------------

The workshop consists of a series of exercises which are indicated in the master branch of the repo by tags.
PLEASE NOTE: If you came to this repo from the droidcon, you should check out branch "droidcon16" and tag "initial_droid_app".

The solutions of each of the exercises are tagged in the repo as well (don't look at them before you've tried the exercise! Don't cheat on me!)

The exercises are:
- Exercise #1: Your first injection! Inject a simple object such as a String.
- Exercise #2: Increase the complexity a little, inject a class. Several solutions included!
- Exercise #3: A real world example, inject a class with dependencies.
- Exercise #4: #PerfMatters... Introducing scopes!
- Exercise #5: Become a master in Dagger 2
- Exercise #6: That's easy, right?

An example of Marvel developer account is provided with the repo, there are 3000 calls per day, enough if you want just to test it, but if you want to try it by yourself, please you'll need your own Marvel account in order to get all the amazing comics from our favorite super heroes.
You can get it at <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/">Developer Marvel</a> by registering and getting a key. Once you have your key, go to string resources in data module and put your key in!
