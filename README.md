Instructions
------------

The workshop consists of a series of exercises which are indicated in the master branch of the repo by tags.
The solutions of each of the exercises are tagged in the repo as well (don't look at them before you've tried the exercise! Don't cheat on me!)

The exercises are:
- Exercise #1: Your first injection! Inject a simple object such as a String.
- Exercise #2: Increase the complexity a little, inject a class. Several solutions included!
- Exercise #3: A real world example, inject a class with dependencies.
- Exercise #4: #PerfMatters... Introducing scopes!
- Exercise #5: Become a master in Dagger 2
- Exercise #6: That's easy, right?

To complete the workshop you'll need a Marvel account in order to get all the amazing comics from our favorite super heroes.
You can get it at <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/">Developer Marvel</a> by registering and getting a key. Once you have your key, go to string resources and put your key in!
